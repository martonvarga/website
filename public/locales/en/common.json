    "myself_description_one": "My name is Márton Varga, I am 23 years old, and I graduated in economics. I have been actively engaged in education since the start of university, teaching and preparing dozens of students annually for central entrance exams, intermediate and advanced-level high school graduation exams, as well as university midterms. <1/><1/>While my main focus remains on advanced-level graduation exams and university-level mathematics courses, I feel that over the years I have developed methods, techniques, and practices that make it possible to tackle even the trickiest tasks of the <strong>8th-grade central entrance exam</strong> and the <strong>intermediate-level graduation exam</strong>. I have also created two specific learning schedules that can prepare students for both exams, even those who generally do not enjoy or feel confident in mathematics.",
    "myself_description_two": "The demand for my lessons has inspired me to make them accessible to a broader range of students, therefore, I also offer intensive, <strong>small-group preparation courses (6-8 students)</strong> for the latter two exams. Naturally, I am also happy to continue working with students who prefer one-on-one tutoring and preparation. You can find more detailed information about my lessons and courses under the relevant tabs. If you are interested, please subscribe to my newsletter."

      "individual_classes_description_one": "I offer mathematics tutoring, consultations, and remedial lessons for upper primary and high school students. I also prepare students for the 8th-grade central entrance exams and the intermediate and advanced-level graduation exams. At the university level, I can assist you with courses such as Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Analysis, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, Economic Mathematics, Statistics, and Econometrics. I have taught students from institutions like Budapest Business School, Metropolitan University, Óbuda University, Corvinus University, and Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Additionally, I provide instruction in English or German course materials, including teaching in English. I have prepared students for Austrian and German graduation exams (the former in English, the latter in Hungarian).",
      "individual_classes_description_two": "Individual consultations allow me to assess the student’s knowledge, identify uncertainties and gaps, and fully tailor my teaching to their needs and pace, guiding them towards their goals. I offer lessons both online and in person. While I am flexible regarding online platforms, in-person sessions are held exclusively at my quiet apartment, conveniently located within walking distance from Keleti Railway Station and the City Park.",

Instead of just filling out tests from previous years, we will work much more effectively, progressing through topics and following the curriculum and schedule I have developed, ensuring that students learn everything necessary for a successful exam.",

    "main_title": "About Me",
    "description1": "I graduated from Petőfi Sándor High School in 2021. During my high school years, I developed a strong interest in languages and mathematics, which led me to pursue further studies in economics. I continued my education at Corvinus University of Budapest, where I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Economics with honors. During my university years, I was a member of the Special Financial Mathematics Student Organization, where I took several courses related to this field each year.",
    "description2": "Together with a classmate, I wrote a thesis for the Scientific Student Association competition in the statistics and econometrics section, and our work was nominated by the jury for the national round. Additionally, I worked as a teaching assistant in econometrics for two semesters, helping with grading assignments and conducting review sessions to prepare students for exams.",
    "description3": "I have been involved in teaching mathematics since the start of my university studies, and during the summers, I also work on decoration projects, primarily for events. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, as well as engaging in sports. Up until high school graduation, I played basketball competitively, but now I prefer running and swimming. I often spend summers at our family vacation home in the Danube Bend; there, I find true relaxation and rejuvenation in gardening, barbecuing with friends, and playing ping pong."
