    "myself_description_one": "My name is Márton Varga, a 22-year-old recent graduate in economics. I have been actively engaged in education since the start of university, teaching and preparing dozens of students annually for central entrance exams, intermediate and advanced-level high school graduation exams, as well as university midterms. While my main focus remains on advanced-level graduation exams and university-level mathematics courses, I feel that over the years I have developed methods, techniques, and practices that make it possible to tackle even the trickiest tasks of the 8th-grade central entrance exam and the intermediate-level graduation exam. I have also created two schedules/syllabi that can prepare students for both exams, even those who generally do not enjoy or feel confident in mathematics.",
    "myself_description_two": "The demand for my lessons has inspired me to make them accessible to a broader range of students without compromising their effectiveness. Therefore, starting from the upcoming fall semester, I will offer intensive, small-group preparation courses (6-8 students) for the latter two exams. Naturally, I am also happy to continue working with students who prefer one-on-one tutoring and preparation. You can find more detailed information about my lessons and courses under the relevant tabs. If you are interested, please subscribe to my newsletter."

      "individual_classes_description_one": "I offer mathematics tutoring, consultations, and remedial lessons for upper primary and high school students. I also prepare students for the 8th-grade central entrance exams and the intermediate and advanced-level graduation exams. At the university level, I can assist you with courses such as Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Analysis, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, Economic Mathematics, Statistics, and Econometrics. I have taught students from institutions like Budapest Business School, Metropolitan University, Óbuda University, Corvinus University, and Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Additionally, I provide instruction in English or German course materials, including teaching in English. I have prepared students for Austrian and German graduation exams (the former in English, the latter in Hungarian).",
      "individual_classes_description_two": "Individual consultations allow me to assess the student’s knowledge, identify uncertainties and gaps, and fully tailor my teaching to their needs and pace, guiding them towards their goals. I offer lessons both online and in person. While I am flexible regarding online platforms, in-person sessions are held exclusively at my quiet apartment, conveniently located within walking distance from Keleti Railway Station and the City Park.",

    "main_title": "About Me",
    "description1": "I graduated from Petőfi Sándor High School in 2021. During my high school years, I developed a strong interest in languages and mathematics, which led me to pursue further studies in economics. I continued my education at Corvinus University of Budapest, where I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Economics with honors. During my university years, I was a member of the Special Financial Mathematics Student Organization, where I took several courses related to this field each year.",
    "description2": "Together with a classmate, I wrote a thesis for the Scientific Student Association competition in the statistics and econometrics section, and our work was nominated by the jury for the national round. Additionally, I worked as a teaching assistant in econometrics for two semesters, helping with grading assignments and conducting review sessions to prepare students for exams.",
    "description3": "I have been involved in teaching mathematics since the start of my university studies, and during the summers, I also work on decoration projects, primarily for events. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, as well as engaging in sports. Up until high school graduation, I played basketball competitively, but now I prefer running and swimming. I often spend summers at our family vacation home in the Danube Bend; there, I find true relaxation and rejuvenation in gardening, barbecuing with friends, and playing ping pong."
